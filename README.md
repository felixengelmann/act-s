# inter-ACT
An R implementation of memory interference processes in linguistic dependency resolution based on ACT-R (Anderson et al., Psychological Review, 2004) and the sentence comprehension model by Lewis and Vasishth (Cognitive Science, 2005), featuring the extensions **Multi-Associative Cues** and **Item Prominence** as described in [F. Engelmann, L. J&auml;ger, and S. Vasishth: *The effect of prominence and cue association in retrieval processes: A computational account* (submitted)](https://osf.io/b56qv/).  

It includes a Shiny App that is hosted at https://engelmann.shinyapps.io/inter-act/ (will be updated to the newest version soon).

Experimental studies reported here are documented in [L. J&auml;ger, F. Engelmann, and S. Vasishth (JML, 2017)](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/felix.engelmann/publications/JaegerEngelmannVasishth2016.pdf).

The extensions Associative Cues and Distractor Prominence are also featured in
[F. Engelmann (Doctoral Thesis, 2016)](https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/10086) and 
[L. J&auml;ger, F. Engelmann, and S. Vasishth (Frontiers in Psychology, 2015)](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00617/abstract).
