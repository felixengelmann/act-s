# inter-ACT
An R implementation of memory interference processes in linguistic dependency resolution based on ACT-R (Anderson et al., Psychological Review, 2004) and the sentence comprehension model by Lewis and Vasishth (Cognitive Science, 2005).  

It includes a Shiny App that is hosted at https://engelmann.shinyapps.io/inter-act/.

It features the extensions **Associative Cues** and **Distractor Prominence** as described in F. Engelmann (Doctoral Thesis, 2016), 
L. J&auml;ger, F. Engelmann, and S. Vasishth (Frontiers in Psychology, 2015), and F. Engelmann, L. J&auml;ger, and S. Vasishth: *Similarity-based interference in sentence comprehension:  A new computational model* (manuscript).

Experimental studies reported here are documented in L. J&auml;ger, F. Engelmann, and S. Vasishth: *Similarity-based interference in sentence comprehension: A literature review and a Bayesian meta-analysis* (submitted).
