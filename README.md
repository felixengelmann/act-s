# inter-ACT
An R implementation of memory interference processes in linguistic dependency resolution based on ACT-R (Anderson et al., Psychological Review, 2004) and the sentence comprehension model by Lewis and Vasishth (Cognitive Science, 2005), featuring the extensions **Associative Cues** and **Distractor Prominence** as described in [F. Engelmann, L. J&auml;ger, and S. Vasishth: *The effect of prominence and cue association in retrieval processes: A computational account* (submitted)](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/felix.engelmann/publications/EJV2016JML.doc.161204.pdf).  

It includes a Shiny App that is hosted at https://engelmann.shinyapps.io/inter-act/.

Experimental studies reported here are documented in [L. J&auml;ger, F. Engelmann, and S. Vasishth: *Lena A. JÃ¤ger, Felix Engelmann, and Shravan Vasishth. Similarity-based interference in sentence comprehension: Literature review and Bayesian meta-analysis. Journal of Memory and Language, 94:316-339, 2017.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X17300049).

The extensions Associative Cues and Distractor Prominence are also featured in
F. Engelmann (Doctoral Thesis, 2016) and 
[L. J&auml;ger, F. Engelmann, and S. Vasishth (Frontiers in Psychology, 2015)](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00617/abstract).
